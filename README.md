## Project Ideas

Participants are encouraged to work on projects that leverage Alfresco technologies.

**For people with a project idea**

For each project, you should consider addressing the following:

* The idea owner(s)
* A brief description
* Any prep work for the project, such as developer tools or skills participants should understand

We encourage you to keep your project idea short and provide any additional details in separate document or blog post within the Collaborate space. This may also allow you to coordinate with potential team members via the comments there without being mixed in with any discussions on this page.

**For people looking to join a project**

Please feel free to add your name to any project(s) you are interested in participating. Don't hesitate to add your name to multiple projects if you are considering multiple at this point. We encourage you to use this platform to contact the owner of an idea to discuss any details you are unsure about or even improve upon the idea.

Apart from any plans you make with the owner of an idea, you are not bound to actually participate in the project you indicated here. When you join the hack-a-thon on the day of the event you can check with other project teams and join a different project, if that turns out to be a better fit for you.

**For people looking for an idea**

If you're searching for ideas to kickstart your project, you've come to the right place. Below, you'll find inspiration drawn from past Hack-a-thon events, an overview of the latest features from Alfresco 7.x, and some exciting possibilities with Alfresco GenAI projects.

**For everyone**

The Hack-a-thon is as much a social event as it is a coding one. This means a lot of the attendees for this event often use it to exchange ideas and discuss other matters in the general Alfresco context.

After the event has come to an end, we encourage everyone that worked on a specific project idea to update the listing on this page with an overview of the project team and a link / reference to the results of the project (e.g. a GitHub repository, document or blog post in this space).

>> Feel free to come up with your own ideas and be creative!

## Community Platform

**Developer Tutorial for Alfresco Repository**

Idea owner: [Angel Borroy](https://github.com/aborroy)

Description: Since Jeff Potts leave us some years ago, the existing reference for [Alfresco Repository developers](https://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series) is a bit outdated.

The main objective is to create a fork from the existing project to improve and enhance the existing material.

Topics to be covered:

- Alfresco Maven SDK
  - Custom Content Types
  - Custom Actions
  - Custom Behaviours
  - Web Scripts
  - Workflows
- CMIS  
- Alfresco Java SDK
  - REST API
  - Messages API

## Content Services

**Complete the Alfresco Community MCP Server**

Idea owner: [Angel Borroy](https://github.com/aborroy) - Steve Reiner

Description: The aim of this project is to add more tools to the [Alfresco Community MCP Server](https://github.com/stevereiner/python-alfresco-mcp-server). Likely working on the `resources` part may help to provide better interactions with the LLM

Prep work:

- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro

**Make the Alfresco CLI Ready**

Idea owner: Angel Borroy](https://github.com/aborroy)

Description: The ALF CLI is an installer without dependencies (pure binary) that is designed to replace the duste (alfresco-docker-installer)[https://github.com/alfresco/alfresco-docker-installer]. Additional administrative operations on the repository can be added, so there is a unique CLI for the installation and the administration of the Repository.

**Alfresco JS Root Objects Colletion**

Idea owner: [Angel Borroy](https://github.com/aborroy)

Description: The aim of this project is to consolidate a set of *missing* JavaScript root objects for use within Alfresco

Scripts placed under `Data Dictionary > Scripts` cannot access Spring beans through `Packages.org.springframework...` for security reasons. As a result, several commonly used features that were previously leveraged in folder rules are no longer available.

Over the last months, multiple projects have been created to reintroduce some of these features as independent root objects:

* [alfresco-b64-jscript-root](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-b64-jscript-root)
* [alfresco-hyland-process-js](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-hyland-process-js)
* [script-rendition-service-2](https://github.com/aborroy/script-rendition-service-2)
* [alfresco-script-root-object](https://github.com/aborroy/alfresco-script-root-object)

The project goal is to consolidate these tools into a unified framework and to extend it further by adding additional root objects, making advanced functionality once again available for rule-based scripting in Alfresco.
